# Substituting-Football-player-using-ML-algorithm
The timing of player substitutions in football can significantly influence the game’s outcome. This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast the optimal time for substituting a player, enhancing decision-making for coaches and strategic planning for teams. Using historical data on player performance, match conditions, and prior coaching decisions, the model will analyze patterns and indicators that impact the effectiveness of substitutions. Key data inputs include individual player metrics (e.g., stamina, speed, and fatigue), game context (e.g., scoreline, opposition strategy, and weather), and historical substitution timings and outcomes. 

Machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning models and time-series analysis, will be employed to identify the best moments for substitution to maximize impact. The resulting model will be validated using past game data and evaluated for accuracy in predicting substitution benefits. This approach has the potential to optimize player management, improve game outcomes, and aid in long-term team strategy planning.outcomes, and aid in long-term team strategy planning.

**#INTRODUCTION**
Football is a sport where the duration of the matches is fixed and the team either loses, wins or draws. In past models, it has been observed that people have developed algorithms to find out how well a team can score goals. These algorithms were used to conclude results. In recent times, the goals being scored by teams are fewer as they are turning towards the defensive approach. 

Also, the result of the match can be decided by the factor whether the team's star player is in the lineup or not i.e. the impact of an individual player on the match. So, in this paper along with team stats we have tried to incorporate individual player’s stats and how that player can impact the team’s overall performance and change the result.

**#PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Suboptimal player substitutions can negatively impact team performance. Determining the ideal time to replace a player is a complex challenge, influenced by multiple factors, including player fatigue, game momentum, and opponent strength.

Impact on Performance:
Improper substitutions can lead to a decrease in team performance due to player fatigue, lack of energy, and reduced effectiveness.

Strategic Disadvantages:
Untimely substitutions can create vulnerabilities in the team's strategy, allowing the opponent to exploit weaknesses and gain an advantage.

Missed Opportunities:
Delaying substitutions can result in missed opportunities to bring in fresh players with specific skills, potentially impacting the outcome of the game.
